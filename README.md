# Google Calender Clone

A calendar application similar to Google Calendar. Each day grid has a + button that allows you to create a new event for the specific day. Clicking on an event should open an edit modal.

If the number of events overflows the calendar day then render a +X More button at the bottom of the day that shows the number of events that overflow. And the number of events rendered will change as the browser resizes.

## Run this app
```
git clone https://github.com/Codefreyy/Calendar-Clone.git
npm i
npm run dev
```

The app is deloyed on netlify with this [link](https://joy-googlecalendar-react-ts.netlify.app/).
